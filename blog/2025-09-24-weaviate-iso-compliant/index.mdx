## Weaviate is ISO 27001 compliant! 🎉
But what does that actually mean for you?

ISO 27001:2022 is the international standard for information security management systems. It requires organizations to systematically manage information security risks through continuous monitoring, regular risk assessments, and appropriate security controls.
The certification involves independent third-party audits that evaluate our security policies, procedures, and technical controls to ensure they meet the highest international standards.
