Multi-vector embeddings represent a single data object, like a document or image, using a set of multiple vectors rather than a single vector. This approach allows for a more granular capture of semantic information, as each vector can represent different parts of the object. However, this leads to a significant increase in memory consumption, as multiple vectors are stored for each item. 

Compression techniques become especially crucial for multi-vector systems to manage storage costs and improve query latency. Compression can generally be achieved through two main techniques: 
- **Quantization**: reduces the memory footprint of individual vectors by approximating their values with less precision.
- **Encoding**: transform the entire set of multi-vectors into a new, more compact single vector representation while aiming to preserve semantic relationships. Â  

## Quantization

Just like with single vectors, multi-vectors support [PQ](./pq-compression.md), [BQ](./bq-compression.md) and [SQ](./sq-compression.md).

During the initial search phase, compressed vectors are used for efficiency. However, when computing the `MaxSim` operation, uncompressed vectors are utilized to ensure more precise similarity calculations. This approach balances the benefits of compression for search efficiency with the accuracy of uncompressed vectors during final scoring.

## Encoding (MUVERA)

MUVERA, which stands for Multi-Vector Retrieval via Fixed Dimensional Encodings, tackles the higher memory usage and slower processing times of multi-vector embeddings by encoding them into single, fixed-dimensional vectors. This leads to reduced memory usage and faster operations compared to traditional multi-vector approaches. Read more about it in this blog post.
